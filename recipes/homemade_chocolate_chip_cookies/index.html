        <h1>Origins of the Chocolate Chip Cookie</h1>
        <p>
          Wondering who invented chocolate chip cookies? This tasty treat was
          actually an accidental invention! (How lucky are we?) The first
          chocolate chip cookie was baked by Ruth Wakefield in the late 1930s.
          As the story goes, Wakefield, who ran the popular Toll House Inn, was
          experimenting with different cookie recipes and decided to add broken
          pieces of semi-sweet chocolate into her cookie dough. That makes sense
          to us, since everything is better with chocolate! She expected the
          chocolate to melt fully and create a chocolate cookie, but the bits of
          chocolate kept their shape—and thus, chocolate chip cookies were
          born!<br /><br />
          Wakefield originally called her creation the Toll House Chocolate
          Crunch Cookie and published it in a cookbook. The rest is tasty
          history, with the cookie gaining popularity worldwide and becoming a
          beloved treat. We’re endlessly thankful for this iconic sweet and all
          the delicious variations that have been developed since!

        <h1>How to Make Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <p>
          This easy chocolate chip cookie recipe comes together in a flash with
          the help of some pantry staples like flour and baking soda. Let’s take
          a quick look at how to make this classic treat. Once you see how easy
          it is, we think you’ll agree that this is the best chocolate chip
          cookie recipe around! The full recipe and ingredients list can be
          found below.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Make Your Dough</strong><br />
          First, you’ll combine a few dry ingredients—flour, baking soda and
          salt—in one bowl. In another bowl, cream the granulated and brown
          sugars into softened butter for a fluffy mixture. Beat in an egg and
          vanilla, then stir in your flour mixture until just blended to form a
          stiff dough. In baking, you’ll typically always mix dry ingredients
          into wet ones for even distribution and mixing. Stir in the chocolate
          chips (an absolute necessity) and nuts (optional), and you’re almost
          ready to bake some delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Shape Cookies</strong><br />
          Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
          You can do this with a spoon, but a scoop makes things extra easy!
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Bake and Enjoy</strong><br />
          Place your cookie sheet in the oven and bake until cookies are a
          beautiful light golden brown at the edges. Let them cool on a wire
          cooling rack. Once fully cooled, serve and enjoy.
        </p>

        <h1>How to Store Chocolate Chip Cookies so They Last Longer</h1>
        <p>
          Nobody likes a stale cookie. So how long are chocolate chip cookies
          good for, and how do you keep them soft and fresh? If you end up with
          leftovers after making this recipe, the baked and cooled cookies can
          easily be stored in a sealed container or food-storage bag at room
          temperature or in the freezer to be enjoyed later. Homemade chocolate
          chip cookies will last for a few days when stored properly on the
          counter and will last even longer when kept in the freezer. When
          frozen, they can last up to 2 months! Find freezing instructions
          below.
